# fgeo 1.1.2 ([GitHub](https://github.com/forestgeo/fgeo/releases) and [drat](https://forestgeo.github.io/drat/))

* [Builds on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/fgeo/builds/) are now tested on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and from R-devel to R 3.2 (see cran-comments.md).

* The website now builds automatically and deploys on the `gh-branch`.

* Automated builds of all __fgeo__ packages can now be tracked not only on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/) but also on to the `#fgeo-builds` channel of [ForestGEO's slack workspace](https://forestgeo.slack.com/) ([request an invitation](https://github.com/forestgeo/forum/issues/new)).

Thanks to the [reviewers](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/authors.html)!
