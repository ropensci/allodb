# Getting help with EDIT-PACKAGE-NAME

Thank you for using __EDIT-PACKAGE-NAME__. Before filing an issue, there are a few places to explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. The reprex will make all of your R-question-asking endeavors easier, and it will only take five to ten minutes to learn all of the details of the package. For
additional reprex pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of the tidyverse site.

Once you have your reprex, the next step is to figure out [where to ask](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#where-to-ask).

* If it is a question: start with
    [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/), and/or StackOverflow. There are more people there to answer questions.
* If it is a bug: you are in the right place, file an issue.
* If you are unsure: let the community help you figure it out! If your problem _is_ a bug or a feature request, you can easily return here and report it. 

Before opening a new issue, be sure to search [issues](https://github.com/forestgeo/EDIT-PACKAGE-NAME/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/forestgeo/EDIT-PACKAGE-NAME/pulls) to make sure the bug has not been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. For example, you would simply remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.

If you _are_ in the right place, and need to file an issue, please review the ["File issues"](https://www.tidyverse.org/contribute/#issues) paragraph from the tidyverse contributing guidelines (wherever you read __tidyverse__ think __EDIT-PACKAGE-NAME__).

Thank you for your help!
