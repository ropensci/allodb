\title{Calibrate new allometric equations}
\usage{
est_params(
  genus,
  coords,
  species = NULL,
  new_eqtable = NULL,
  wna = 0.1,
  w95 = 500,
  nres = 10000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genus}{a character vector, containing the genus (e.g. "Quercus") of
each tree.}

\item{coords}{a numeric vector of length 2 with longitude and latitude (if
all trees were measured in the same location) or a matrix with 2 numerical
columns giving the coordinates of each tree.}

\item{species}{a character vector (same length as genus), containing the
species (e.g. "rubra")  of each tree. Default is \code{NULL}, when no species
identification is available.}

\item{new_eqtable}{Optional. An equation table created with the
\code{\link[=new_equations]{new_equations()}} function. Default is the compiled \emph{allodb} equation
table.}

\item{wna}{a numeric vector, this parameter is used in the \code{\link[=weight_allom]{weight_allom()}}
function to determine the dbh-related and sample-size related weights
attributed to equations without a specified dbh range or sample size,
respectively. Default is 0.1.}

\item{w95}{a numeric vector, this parameter is used in the \code{\link[=weight_allom]{weight_allom()}}
function to determine the value at which the sample-size-related weight
reaches 95\% of its maximum value (max=1). Default is 500.}

\item{nres}{number of resampled values. Default is "1e4".}
}
\value{
An object of class "data.frame" of fitted coefficients (columns) of
the non-linear least-square regression:
\deqn{AGB = a * dbh ^ b + e, \space
  \mathit{with} \space e ~ N(0, sigma^2)}{AGB = a * dbh ^ b + e, with e ~
  N(0, sigma^2)}
}
\description{
This function calibrates new allometric equations from sampling previous
ones. New allometric equations are calibrated for each species and location
by resampling the original compiled equations; equations with a larger sample
size, and/or higher taxonomic rank, and climatic similarity with the species
and location in question are given a higher weight in this process.

\examples{
# calibrate new allometries for all Lauraceae species
lauraceae <- subset(scbi_stem1, Family == "Lauraceae")
est_params(
  genus = lauraceae$genus,
  species = lauraceae$species,
  coords = c(-78.2, 38.9)
)
