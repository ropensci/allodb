\arguments{
\item{subset_taxa}{character vector with taxa to be kept. Default is "all",
in which case all taxa are kept.}

\item{subset_climate}{character vector with Koppen climate classification to
be kept. Default is "all", in which case all climates are kept.}

\item{subset_region}{character vector with name of location(s) or
country(ies) or broader region(s) (eg. "Europe", "North America") to be
kept. Default is "all", in which case all regions/countries are kept.}

\item{subset_ids}{character vector with equation IDs to be kept. Default is
"all", in which case all equations are kept.}

\item{subset_output}{What dependent variable(s) should be provided in the
output? Default is "Total aboveground biomass" and "Whole tree (above
stump)", other possible values are: "Bark biomass", "Branches (dead)",
"Branches (live)", "Branches total (live, dead)", "Foliage total",
"Height", "Leaves", "Stem (wood only)", "Stem biomass", "Stem biomass (with
bark)", "Stem biomass (without bark)", "Whole tree (above and
belowground)". Be aware that currently only a few equations represent those
other variables, so estimated values might not be very accurate.}

\item{new_taxa}{character string or vector specifying the taxon (or taxa) for
which the allometry has been calibrated.}

\item{new_allometry}{a character string with the allometric equation.}

\item{new_coords}{a vector or matrix of coordinates (longitude, latitude) of
the calibration data.}

\item{new_min_dbh}{numerical value, minimum DBH for which the equation is
valid (in cm). Default is \code{NULL} (nothing is added).}

\item{new_max_dbh}{numerical value, maximum DBH for which the equation is
valid (in cm). Default is \code{NULL} (nothing is added).}

\item{new_sample_size}{number of measurements with which the allometry was
calibrated. Default is \code{NULL} (nothing is added).}

\item{new_unit_dbh}{character string with unit of DBH in the equation (either
\code{cm}, \code{mm} or \code{inch}). Default is "cm".}

\item{new_unit_output}{character string with unit of equation output (either
"g", "kg", "Mg" or "lbs" if the output is a mass, or "m" if the output is a
height).}

\item{new_input_var}{independent variable(s) needed in the allometry. Default
is "DBH", other option is "DBH, H".}

\item{new_output_var}{dependent variable estimated by the allometry. Default
is "Total aboveground biomass".}

\item{use_height_allom}{a logical value. In \emph{allodb} we use Bohn et al.
(2014) for European sites. User need to provide height allometry when
needed to calculate AGB. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class "data.frame" of new equations.
}
\description{
This function modifies the original equation table to be used in other
functions of the package including: subset the original equation table, add
new equations, and choose whether to include equations with a height
allometry.
