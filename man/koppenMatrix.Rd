\title{Koppen climate classification matrix}
\format{
An object of class \code{data.frame} with 900 rows and 3 columns.
}
\usage{
koppenMatrix
}
\description{
A table built to facilitate the comparison between the Koppen climate of a
site and the allometric equation in question. This table is used in the
weighting scheme in the weight_allom() function.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{koppenMatrix}: A data frame with two columns depicting the 3-letter system
of the Koppen climate scheme and the given weight when comparing
site/equation climate.
}

The value of column \code{wE} is the weight given to the combination of Koppen
climates in columns \code{zone1}and \code{zone2}; the table is symmetric: \code{zone1}and
\code{zone2} can be interchanged. This weight is calculated in 3 steps: (1) if the
main climate group (first letter) is the same, the climate weight starts at
0.4; if one of the groups is "C" (temperate climate) and the other is "D"
(continental climate), the climate weight starts at 0.2 because the 2 groups
are considered similar enough; otherwise, the weight is 0; (2) if the
equation and site belong to the same group, the weight is incremented by an
additional value between 0 and 0.3 based on precipitation pattern similarity
(second letter of the Koppen zone), and (3) by an additional value between 0
and 0.3 based on temperature pattern similarity (third letter of the Koppen
zone). The resulting weight has a value between 0 (different climate groups)
and 1 (exactly the same climate classification).
