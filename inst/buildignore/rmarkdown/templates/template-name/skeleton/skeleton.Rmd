# About this template

This document produces two types of output:

1. .html: Good for websites; Themed consistently with other .html files of the
   __fgeo__ development.
2. .md: Good for GitHub -- but notice that the custom theme will be lost.

Both outputs will show a rendered version of this .Rmd file.

If you don't want the .html file you may add it to .gitignore -- an easy way to do this is with `usethis::use_git_ignore()`. Or edit the yaml header of this file:

* Replace `html_output` with `github_output`.
* Remove `theme: united`.
* Remove `keep_md: true`.

# Get started

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
