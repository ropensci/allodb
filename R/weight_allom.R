#' Attribute weights to equations
#'
#' This function attributes a weight to each equation based on its sampling
#' size, and taxonomic and climatic similarity with the species/site combination
#' considered.
#'
#' Each equation is given a weight by the function [weight_allom()], calculated
#' as the product of the following components:
#'
#' (1) sample-size weight, calculated as:
#'
#' \deqn{1-exp(-n*(log(20)/w95))}
#'
#' where n is the sample size of the equation; the weight given to equations
#' with no sample size information is determined by argument `wna` (0.1 by
#' default).
#'
#' (2) climate weight, based on the similarity between the climatic conditions
#' of the equation site and the target location, using the three-letter system
#' of Koppen's climate scheme. Climate weights associated with each combination
#' of two Koppen climates are provided in `data("koppenMatrix")`. The resulting
#' weight has a value between 1e-6 (different climate groups) and 1 (exactly the
#' same climate classification). When an equation was calibrated with trees from
#' several locations with different Koppen climates, the maximum value out of
#' all pairwise equation-site climate weights is used.
#'
#' (3) taxonomic weight: equal to 1 for same species equations, 0.8 for same
#' genus equations, 0.5 for same family equations and for equations calibrated
#' for the same broad functional or taxonomic group (e.g. shrubs, conifers,
#' angiosperms). All other equations are given a low taxonomic weight of 1e-6:
#' these equations will have a significant relative weight in the final
#' prediction only when no other more specific equation is available.
#'
#' @param genus a character value, containing the genus (e.g. "Quercus") of the
#'   tree.
#' @param coords a numeric vector of length 2 with longitude and latitude.
#' @param species a character vector (same length as genus), containing the
#'   species (e.g. "rubra") of the tree. Default is `NULL`, when no species
#'   identification is available.
#' @param new_eqtable Optional. An equation table created with the
#'   [new_equations()] function.
#' @param wna a numeric vector, this parameter is used in the [weight_allom()]
#'   function to determine the sample-size related weights attributed to
#'   equations without a specified sample size. Default is 0.1.
#' @param w95 a numeric vector, this parameter is used to determine the value at
#'   which the sample-size-related weight reaches 95% of its maximum value
#'   (max=1). Default is 500.
#'
#' @return A named "numeric" vector with one weight for each equation.
